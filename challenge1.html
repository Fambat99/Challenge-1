        <h1>THEN LAUGH</h1>
        <h3>BY BERTHA ADAMS BACKUS</h3>
        <p>Build for yourself a strong box, <br>
            Fashion each part with care; <br>
            When it's strong as your hand can make it, <br>
            Put all your troubles there; <br>
            Hide there all thought of your failures, <br>
            And each bitter cup that you quaff; <br>
            Lock all your heartaches within it, <br>
            Then sit on the lid and laugh. <br>
        </p>
        <p>Tell no one else its contents, <br>
            Never its secrets share; <br>
            When you've dropped in your care and worry, <br>
            Keep them forever there; <br>
            Hide them from sight so completely, <br>
            That the world will never dream half; <br>
            Fasten the strong box securely, <br>
            Then sit on the lid and laugh. <br>
        </p>
    </body>
